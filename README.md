Task details:
1. Create a Django or Node.js or Go or ‘Ruby on Rails’ Application which shows a simple format "/user-form". The form
asks the user for his details(name, date of birth, email, phone number). The form is rendered in any of the modern
frontend frameworks like React.js, Vue.js or Angular. The date of the birth field should be a calendar option.
2. The user fills the form and presses submit. Perform basic front-end validation on the name, email, DoB (age cannot
be less than 18 years).
3. Phone number validation happens at the backend. If you are using Django then Django-Rest-Framework is
preferred. If RoR, node.js or Go or Scala, use the relevant framework/suggested best practice for writing modular
code.
4. Save the form and send an email to the form submitter.
5. After the form is submitted redirect the user to a page where all the submitted forms are displayed.
5. Deploy your code onto a free cloud server of your choice such as Heroku/Pythonanywhere and share the live
link/URL with us to test.
